# Solar-Inverter-Sizing-Calculator
Solar & Inverter Sizing Calculator
This application provides an intuitive tool for calculating the optimal solar and inverter requirements based on household or business power demands. Users can input their desired backup time and the electrical loads they need to support, and the calculator recommends the appropriate size and quantity of inverters, batteries, solar panels, and charge controllers.

Key Features:
Inverter Sizing: Automatically rounds up inverter sizes to the nearest 500kVA, with recommendations for multiple inverters for larger systems.
Battery Recommendations: Based on system voltage and load, battery capacity is calculated in kWh to ensure proper energy storage.
Solar Panel Sizing: Users can select their preferred solar panel type (270W, 300W, 440W, 550W, 600W), and the application calculates the number of panels required.
Appliance Power Ratings: Includes a dropdown menu of common household appliances with editable power ratings, allowing users to fine-tune calculations to match their specific devices.
User-Friendly Interface: A chat prompt guides users through the process, helping them confirm and adjust appliance power ratings as needed.
This calculator helps both homeowners and engineers quickly estimate solar and inverter needs, ensuring energy efficiency and reliability.
